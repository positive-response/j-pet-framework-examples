# Large Barrel Analysis

## Aim
This example show a full analysis of data from the J-PET Big Barrel, which is so far the best attempt for J-PET data reconstruction.

## Expected output
No output to stdout.
`JPet_(date).log` file appears with the log of the processing and ROOT files with the following extensions are produced:  
`*.tslot.calib.root`  
`*.raw.sig.root`  
`*.phys.sig.root`  
`*.hits.root`  
`*.unk.evt.root`  
`*.cat.evt.root`  

where `*` stands for the name of the input file.

## Input Data
For this example, the user must provide her/his own data file(s) collected with the Big Barrel. Moreover, useful files with configurations and calibrations are downloaded during the `cmake` build to `CalibrationFiles` folder in the source folder. 

## Description
The analysis is split into tasks.

## Additional info
For description of possible parameters, that can be ised in `useParams.json`, see file [PARAMETERS](PARAMETERS.md). Please note that if the `-o output_directory_path` command line option is provided, the output files will be created in the specified output path and not in the directory of the input file.

## Compiling
Executable:  
`make`  
Tests for tools classes:  
`make tests_LargeBarrel`

## Running
The script `run.sh` contains an example of running the analysis. Note, however, that the user must fill the input data file name and the number of run. Please consult the contents of the `run.sh` script for the command-line options that need to be provided in order to run the data analysis correctly.
